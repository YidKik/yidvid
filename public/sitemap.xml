I notice that the AI's response contains a comment `<!-- ... keep existing code (all video entries with yidvid.co URLs) -->` but the original file content for `public/sitemap.xml` was not provided in your message. 

Without the original `public/sitemap.xml` file content showing all the video entries, I cannot reconstruct the complete file. The AI was trying to replace all instances of `yidvid.com` with `yidvid.co` in the video URLs, but I need to see what those original video entries looked like.

Could you please provide the contents of the original `public/sitemap.xml` file so I can generate the corrected version with all `yidvid.com` URLs replaced with `yidvid.co`?
